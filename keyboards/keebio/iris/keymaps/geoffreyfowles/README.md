## Bugs
- One shot mods on layer send key to computer immediately after switching layers
  - would want them to send only AFTER pressing the next key, or not at all if cancelled
- Dynamic macros don't change layer color when running
  - e.g. record macro that switches to gaming layer. when running, macro finishes and keyboard maintains gaming color, but is actually back in base layer

## TODOs
- Figure out how to change to _EXTRA_FN layer on key down without pressing F20
